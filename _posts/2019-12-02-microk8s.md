[Kubernetes (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io/){:target="_blank"} has become the defacto standard for containers orchestration, and since I like to do 
some more example about it I was needed to setup it on my system.

In the past I've use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/){:target="_blank"} for running a local installation of k8s on my environment but since I recently switched to [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/){:target="_blank"} for most of my development I decided to to use [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/){:target="_blank"}. 

MicroK8s is a small, fast and very simple to install, even for clustering, k8s in a single package, created by [Canonical](https://canonical.com/){:target="_blank"} the company behind [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/){:target="_blank"}.

One the benefits for using Microk8s on Linux is that its run natively (without virtualization), and since Mint is base on Ubuntu this installation is even easer. On Windows and Mac you will need to use [Micropass](https://multipass.run/){:target="_blank"} to run a virtual machine with Ubuntu first. 

Minikube uses virtualization in all of the OS that runs, even in linux, and for this is more resource intensive, however is developed by the same team that develop k8s, regardless both are [CNF certified](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/){:target="_blank"} k8s solutions. MicroK8s tracks upstream releases of k8s to keep itself up to date with k8s development.

**Installing Snap**

We will install microk8s using an [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/){:target="_blank"}.

[Snaps](https://snapcraft.io/){:target="_blank"} are linux app packages for desktop, cloud and IoT that are easy to install, secure and cross-platform, they are self-contained, including dependencies, and they could be uninstalled without affecting the rest of your system.

From Ubuntu 14.04 LTS onwards snap is already installed, for previous versions we need to install it with apt :

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install snapd
{% endhighlight %}

After installed we could just check the version that we have using :

{% highlight bash %}
$ snap version 
snap       2.42.1+18.04
snapd      2.42.1+18.04
series     16
linuxmint  19.2
kernel     4.15.0-72-generic
{% endhighlight %}

**Installing MicroK8s**

Now that we have snap we could install MicroK8s just doing : 

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo snap install microk8s --classic
microk8s v1.16.3 from Canonicalâœ“ installed
{% endhighlight %}

In order tu use MicroK8s we need either to use sudo or add our **username** to the microk8s group:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo usermod -a -G microk8s username
{% endhighlight %}

After login in back again we could not check the status of our k8s cluster with :

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.status
microk8s is running
{% endhighlight %}

If we want to stop or start our cluster we could do it using `microk8s.stop` or `microk8s.start` whenever we need.

MicroK8s provide several commands to manage our cluster, but embed within the installation for example if we want
to see what is running in our cluster using [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/){:target="_blank"} we need to do:

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl get all --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE   NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
default     service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.152.183.1   <none>        443/TCP   17m
{% endhighlight %}

**Adding addons**

Microk8s installation is very minimal if we like to have a dashboard we need to enable as an [addon](https://microk8s.io/docs/addons){:target="_blank"}, 
they are several of them so we will enable some basics ones :

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.enable dashboard dns registry fluentd
{% endhighlight %}

**Using the dashboard**

For using the dashboard we need first to find the IP address in our cluster, for this we could just do :

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl get service kubernetes-dashboard -n kube-system

NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes-dashboard   ClusterIP   10.152.183.75   <none>        443/TCP   28m
{% endhighlight %}

No we know that our dashboard is running at [https://10.152.183.75](https://10.152.183.75){:target="_blank"}, however we need a access token for using it, 
we could get the token with the following commands:

Get from secrets the default-token secret name:
{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl get secret -n kube-system | grep default-token
default-token-gkjsl                              kubernetes.io/service-account-token
{% endhighlight %}

Get the token, that is the value for the secret name:

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl describe secret default-token-gkjsl -n kube-system 
{% endhighlight %}

Now with this token we can logon into our dashboard:

[![d](/assets/img/captures/kubernetes_dashboard_logon.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/kubernetes_dashboard_logon.jpg){:target="_blank"}

We will choose to use a token and we will use the one that we just get, and finally we will see our dashboard:

[![d](/assets/img/captures/kubernetes_dashboard.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/kubernetes_dashboardjpg){:target="_blank"}

**Adding a demo application**

For configuring further our MicroK8s we will deploy a new application with two replicas:

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl create deployment microbot --image=dontrebootme/microbot:v1
deployment.apps/microbot created
$ microk8s.kubectl scale deployment microbot --replicas=2
{% endhighlight %}

Now we could check that we have actually two pods runing with :

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl get pod --selector=app=microbot
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
microbot-5bb7fd7f5d-dshtf   1/1     Running   0          2m30s
microbot-5bb7fd7f5d-mdcvs   1/1     Running   0          3m30s
{% endhighlight %}

To access to our applicacion we will expose it trough a NodePort : 

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl expose deployment microbot --type=NodePort --port=80 \
    --name=microbot-service
service/microbot-service exposed
{% endhighlight %}

We could check our services with :

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl get service --selector=app=microbot                                      
NAME               TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
microbot-service   NodePort   10.152.183.136   <none>        80:31771/TCP   2m27s
{% endhighlight %}

And since is a NodePort we could use with the IP of our local machine at http://localhost :

[![d](/assets/img/captures/microbot.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/microbot.jpg){:target="_blank"}

If we refresh the page invalidating cache, shift+ctrl+r on Firefox, we will get different containers for this application.

**Configuring Kibana**

Since we original add the addon fluentd we have a Elasticsearch + Kibana for our pods logs, but we need the URL Kibana, 
listing the cluster info will display urls for the addons that we have installed:

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl cluster-info

Kubernetes master is running at https://127.0.0.1:16443
Elasticsearch is running at https://127.0.0.1:16443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/elasticsearch-logging/proxy
Heapster is running at https://127.0.0.1:16443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster/proxy
Kibana is running at https://127.0.0.1:16443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kibana-logging/proxy
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:16443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
Grafana is running at https://127.0.0.1:16443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/monitoring-grafana/proxy
InfluxDB is running at https://127.0.0.1:16443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/monitoring-influxdb:http/proxy
{% endhighlight %}

However before accessing we need the user and password for managing this cluster this could obtain with the command

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl config view
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
    server: https://127.0.0.1:16443
  name: microk8s-cluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: microk8s-cluster
    user: admin
  name: microk8s
current-context: microk8s
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: admin
  user:
    password: aRZbT45aNLB3AYUaz2rVa2RtzACoUR3zOGZoeWQ4c016SjlJSUt6bXNlRT0K
    username: admin
{% endhighlight %}

Now we could visit our Kibana in the url https://127.0.0.1:16443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kibana-logging/proxy and use our
admin user and password.

[![d](/assets/img/captures/kibana_main.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/kibana_main.jpg){:target="_blank"}

However if we like to browse the data when clicking on Discover we will get redirect to create an index, the pattern will be `logstash*`:

[![d](/assets/img/captures/kibana_index.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/kibana_index.jpg){:target="_blank"}

And finally we will set our *Time Filter field name* to be `@timestamp`:

[![d](/assets/img/captures/kibana_index_2.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/kibana_index_2.jpg){:target="_blank"}

Now we could click on *Create index pattern* to complete our index creation.

For testing our index lets deploy another service to our cluster, one application that output on the logs random name into the stdout :

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl create deployment random-generator --image=chriscmsoft/random-generator:latest
deployment.apps/random-generator created
$ microk8s.kubectl scale deployment random-generator --replicas=2
$ microk8s.kubectl get all --selector=app=random-generator                                       
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/random-generator-7b6c47d877-plbsg   1/1     Running   0          54s
pod/random-generator-7b6c47d877-wh4jj   1/1     Running   0          11s

NAME                               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/random-generator   2/2     2            2           54s

NAME                                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/random-generator-7b6c47d877   2         2         2       54
{% endhighlight %}

We could check the log of this service with : 
{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl logs --selector=app=random-generator
{"name": "Gara, The Magnificent"}
{"name": "Gairvol, The Puny"}
{"name": "Zyvrieliar, The Swift"}
{"name": "Gara, The Magnificent"}
{"name": "Xaymmynth, Champion Of The Blue"}
{"name": "Chynnyrth, Champion Of Men"}
{"name": "Xaerlulth, The Warm"}
{"name": "Xarsot, The Tyrant"}
{"name": "Xaerlulth, The Warm"}
{"name": "Xaerlulth, The Warm"}
{"name": "Siovaeloi, Protector Of The Weak"}
{"name": "Siovaeloi, Protector Of The Weak"}
{"name": "Zaellyt, The Gifted One"}
{"name": "Gorsolun, Warmheart"}
{"name": "Vugeo, The Youngling"}
{"name": "Vugeo, The Youngling"}
{"name": "Xughus, The Tall"}
{"name": "Xaerlulth, The Warm"}
{"name": "Gorsolun, Warmheart"}
{% endhighlight %}

Now back into Kibana we could just do a simple filter `kubernetes.container_name: random-generator` and select the `docker` and `log` fields to view the logs
of this application.

[![d](/assets/img/captures/kibana_search.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/kibana_search.jpg){:target="_blank"}


**Configuring Grafana**

As we did for Kibana we could grab the url for Grafana for the cluster info, this case is https://127.0.0.1:16443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/monitoring-grafana/proxy , we will need our admin user and password as we needed before.

[![d](/assets/img/captures/grafana_login.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/grafana_login.jpg){:target="_blank"}

MicroK8s has already configure some dashboard we could choose *Pods* and then select our *default* namespace an any of our random-generator pods to look some of
the graphs.

[![d](/assets/img/captures/grafana_pod.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/grafana_pod.jpg){:target="_blank"}

The defaul Pod dashboard allow us to just select one pod let modify it to allow to choose several.

Click on the gear icon on Grafana and choose *Templating* :

[![d](/assets/img/captures/grafana_templating.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/grafana_templating.jpg){:target="_blank"}

Now on the field *$podname* we click on the *Edit* button.

[![d](/assets/img/captures/grafana_podname.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/grafana_podname.jpg){:target="_blank"}

We need to activate *Multi-value* on the *Selection Options* and then click now *Update*, sometimes the field Data Source get set to blank we need to set it to *influxdb-dataset*.

With this now could close the Templating and choose all of the pods for our random-generator to get an update graph with the sum of both pods.

[![d](/assets/img/captures/grafana_all_pods.jpg){:style="width:80%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}](/assets/img/captures/grafana_all_pods.jpg){:target="_blank"}

**Clean up**

Now that we have test some of the tools in our MicroK8s installation we could delete the applications that we do not need anymore :

{% highlight bash %}
$ microk8s.kubectl delete all --selector=app=microbot
pod "microbot-5bb7fd7f5d-dshtf" deleted
pod "microbot-5bb7fd7f5d-mdcvs" deleted
service "microbot-service" deleted
deployment.apps "microbot" deleted
replicaset.apps "microbot-5bb7fd7f5d" deleted

$ microk8s.kubectl delete all --selector=app=random-generator 
pod "random-generator-7b6c47d877-plbsg" deleted
pod "random-generator-7b6c47d877-wh4jj" deleted
deployment.apps "random-generator" deleted
replicaset.apps "random-generator-7b6c47d877" deleted
{% endhighlight %}

**Conclusions**

MicroK8s is very easy to install it took just seconds to download and get it ready, it provide many already config addons that allows use it easily and
kickstart a k8s cluster very fast with everything that we need, and is really slim and fast so a really good candidate for IoT deployments.

I've enjoy a lot this installation and I'm looking forward to learn more of k8s using MicroK8s, they are several addons that I'ven't tryout yet such [Istio](https://istio.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Knative](https://knative.dev/){:target="_blank"}, maybe in a nearby future.
