I found the other day a wonderful package for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3){:target="_blank"}, [MongoExec](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MongoExec){:target="_blank"}.

Allows to execute MongoDB queries within sublime text and other stuff like browse database a collection.

In understand that there is available a lot of tools to browse a Mongo database but the got things of having this as a sublime package is that allow to do everything within sublime, so more productivity.

I like to copy fields and data within the same editor.

So far love it.
