Right now there is a lot of traction on the Serverless architecture so I decide to give a try and do some examples using Kotlin.

First I recommend to read this [article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html){:target="_blank"} by [Mike Roberts](https://twitter.com/mikebroberts){:target="_blank"} from Martin Fowler website to get a bit more understanding on what is a Serverless architecture.
